# Queue names *must* be in the normal UUID format: run "uuidgen" and use the
# output as your queue name. If you don't define a queue here, the server will
# generate a queue name for you. This queue will be non-durable, auto-deleted and
# exclusive.
# If your queue is not exclusive, anyone can connect and consume from it, causing
# you to miss messages, so do not share your queue name. Any queues that are not
# auto-deleted on disconnect are garbage-collected after approximately one hour.
#
# If you require a stronger guarantee about delivery, please talk to Fedora's
# Infrastructure team.

# If you use the server-generated queue names, you can leave out the "queue"
